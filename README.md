## About The Project

This project uses historical IPL match data to build machine learning models that predict the final score of an ongoing IPL match based on current match statistics like overs played, runs scored, wickets lost, and recent performance.

## Features

- Data preprocessing using One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables (teams).
- Season-wise train-test split to prevent data leakage.
- Model training and comparison: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost.
- Evaluation with MAE, MSE, RMSE metrics.
- Easy-to-use prediction function for live match score estimation.
